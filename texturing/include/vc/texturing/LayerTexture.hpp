 * @brief Generate a Texture of layered images
 *
 * The Texture generated by this class contains multiple texture images. Each
 * image is the projection of the mesh some distance through the Volume along
 * each point's surface normal. For well-formed meshes and parameterizations,
 * this amounts to resampling the Volume into a flattened subvolume with the
 * segmentation mesh forming a straight line at its center.
