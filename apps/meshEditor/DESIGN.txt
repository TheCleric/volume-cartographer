1. Pipeline of the tool
(1) Load 3D model. The model G will be shown in the 3D view.
(2) Load volume packager and specify the slice index. The slice image will be shown in the 2D view and the slice plane will
    be overlaid in the 3D view.

2. UI of the tool
3D view: shows mesh model and slice plane and responds to user interaction.
2D view: shows the cross section curve and responds to user interaction.

Specific design:
1. Mouse drag and drop on 2D to change 3D:
(1) use mouse to change the 2D curve (in C2DView)
(2) update corresponding 3D mesh (in CMeshGL)
(3) re-generate the texture (run textureGen again)
